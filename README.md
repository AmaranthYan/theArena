This prototype project to demonstrate my idea of VR specialized FPS games that I made during 6 months  
## Intro
When I was working on my 3rd year Fil-Rouge project (one of the school projects at INSA CS department) , some questions occurred to me : how do we define a game that is *specialized* for the VR technology? what are the differences between such a game and those traditional 3D games with VR supports?  
What I would like to present here is a prototype that I had for VR specilized FPS games. The idea is that by seperating the camera rendering of the two views of humain eyes while aiming, it gives the player a more realistic shooting experience.  
I also added some other features to the project such as a weapon assembly workshop which allows the player to assemble its own weapon step by step.  
Here is an image demo :
